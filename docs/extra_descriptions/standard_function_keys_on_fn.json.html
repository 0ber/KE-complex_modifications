<h2>Solution to profile dependent F key swap</h2>
<p>
	There are 3 options:
	<ol>
	  <li>Stick to the media keys set as default (checkbox off)* and assign F1 to F1 etc. in the Function Keys menu for profile.</li>
	  <li>Stick to the media keys set as default (checkbox off)* and activate swap key function option (option 2) for given profiles.  Drawback: causes Touch Bar to flicker when f keys are pressed (no problem with media function keys).</li>
	  <li>Best solution, allows fastest setup of a profile, but requires switching to F1, F2 as default (checkbox on)*. You will have f keys as default so just select this third option ("Keep normal media keys funtionality...") for the profiles, where you want to use media function keys as default. This is inverted method so to say.</li>
	</ol>
	*I mean checkbox on the bottom of Function Keys menu to use F1, F2 etc. as default.
